/**
 * In node environments, it might be necessary to set up a custom agent to
 * control the network requests being made.
 *
 * To do this, we have a mutable agent variable that can be set externally. For
 * this to work we need to ensure no other dependencies have loaded yet. That's
 * why this module is seperate from the fetch.ts file which simply re-exports
 * this variable. This way the patching code can simply import this specific
 * file and gain early acceessss to the agentRef
 *
 * ðŸš¨ Do not import this file unless you're specifically patching the variable.
 * For read only access simply import the fetch.ts file
